I'm not ready to write this blog post.
I don't clearly know what it is I'm supposed to say, or how I should say it.
I'm inclined, frankly, to put it off, to pace around my apartment some more, to think about it until the end of time.
I seem to convince myself that the longer I think about something, the longer I let it sit in the back of my mind, the better, the more developed, the more refined it'll get.
I have little evidence to bear this out.
In fact, it would seem the opposite is true.
The longer an idea is allowed to marinate, the more dogmatic I become about it, the more disposed I am to accept the idea not because of its quality, but because of its familiarity.

The reason I find it so easy to convince myself of this, I think, is that it saves me the terror of having to set myself to work on something whose shape I can't yet clearly envision.
There is such a thing as an idea that's been overworked.
Like a dough that's been kneaded too much, it becomes tightly bound, inflexible.

And some of the best ideas are those that come screaming off the top of your head, straight from the id, and make it onto paper before your rational mind has had a chance to edit or censor.
The question becomes, how do you put yourself in a position to have more of those screaming id moments?
