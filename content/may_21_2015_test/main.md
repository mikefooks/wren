There's something peculiar about writing this way, so quickly, not allowing my mind to keep pace with my fingers.
I see my brain getting tired and falling behind, and as it does so, something uncanny happens in my fingers.
Something that is both not me and more me than anything else emerges when I stop thinking so hard.
It's as if I'm there all along, but am only revealed to myself the moment I stop looking.
