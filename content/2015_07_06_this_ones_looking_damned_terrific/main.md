This time it'll work.
Not that it hasn't worked any of the other times.
It's a sensation I'm looking for, more than an outcome.
There's a feeling of satiety, that seems to be mildly correlated, but not at all correspondent to, the value that other people place on the things that I do.

I'm not ready to write this blog post.
I don't clearly know what it is I'm supposed to say, or how I should say it.
I'm inclined, frankly, to put it off, to pace around my apartment some more, to think about it until the end of time.
I've convinced myself that the longer I think about something, the longer I let it sit in the back of my mind, the better, the more developed, the more refined it'll get.
I have little evidence to support this out.
In fact, if I'm being honest, the opposite seems more likely.
The longer an idea is allowed to marinate, the more dogmatic I become about it, the more disposed I am to accept the idea not because of its quality, but because of its familiarity.

The reason I find it so easy to convince myself of this, I think, is that it saves me the terror of having to set myself to work on something whose shape isn't yet clear to me.
There are few things more difficult (and I mean "difficult" here in a very quotidian sense---obviously dying of thirst or fighting off wild animals is more difficult in absolute terms) than setting oneself to work on something without any certainty that it will turn out any good.
This is the sort of hum-drum bravery that characterizes the existence of artists.
Anything new is an unknown quantity, and that means risk is involved---risk that it won't be any good, or the risk that it'll uncover something that's painful or uncomfortable.
There is such a thing as an idea that's been overworked.
Like a dough that's been kneaded too much, it becomes tightly bound, inflexible.

And some of the best ideas are those that come screaming off the top of your head, straight from the id, and make it onto paper before your rational mind has had a chance to edit or censor.
The question becomes, how do you put yourself in a position to have more of those screaming id moments?
